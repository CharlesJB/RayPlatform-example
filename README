This is an example program that utilises the Ray Platform.
The RayPlatform main class is called ComputeCore.
Plugins can be registered with the core.

In this example, there is only one plugin called TestPlugin.
In this example, a message containing an integer is passed. At each reception,
the integer is decremented. When it reaches 0, the computation ends.

== To test this example ==

RayPlatform is a symbolic link to ../RayPlatform

You need to clone RayPlatform in the parent directory

	git clone git://github.com/sebhtml/RayPlatform.git
	git clone git://github.com/sebhtml/RayPlatform-example.git
	cd RayPlatform-example

	make

	mpiexec -n 8 ./distributedApplication | less
